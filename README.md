# This is a Test Repository with a Backlog of fake tickets

_It is being watched by the GH-Scrum-Poker Marketplace App beta_

- test #2
- test #3
- test #4
- test #5 (add arrow fn syntax to pr event listener in request)
- test #6 (testing pvt key buffer for error (using reliable pem path))
- test #7 (changed all env vars to match first tutorial GH app id, webhook secret, key)
  - if test #7 works that implies some sort of misfire with setting up the GH Scrum Poker app on GH?
  - the app on GH is the wrong app and we are sending it the wrong credentials. How do I configure which App on GH we are sending to??
- test #8 (made sure GH Tutorial app is watching only colin/scrum-poker-test && changed to correct pvt key PATH for node server)
  - take II


- test #7 continued...
  - I have a bad feeling the GH app that is running on GH and expecting a request is my very first tutorial based app.
  - I wonder where I miss-stepped in the configuration of that app on GH GUI.
  - Or, if having too many up on GH is bad? Redirecting webhook payloads from multiple apps? All to one proxy?
